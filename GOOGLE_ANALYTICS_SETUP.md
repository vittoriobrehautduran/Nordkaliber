## Step 4: Update Your Website

### Option A: Direct Code Implementation (Recommended for Static Sites)

1. Open all HTML files: `index.html`, `designpage.html`, `checkout.html`, `success.html`
2. Find the Google Analytics section in each file
3. Replace `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` with your actual Measurement ID

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Google Analytics 4 -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX', {
        page_title: 'Nordkaliber - Premium Jaktutrustning',
        page_location: window.location.href
    });
</script>
```

### Option B: Environment Variable (For Dynamic Sites)

If you want to use environment variables (more secure but requires server-side processing):

1. **For Netlify**: Add environment variable in Netlify dashboard
   - Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` with your Measurement ID

2. **Update the code** to use environment variable:
```html
<script>
    const GA_MEASUREMENT_ID = '{{GA_MEASUREMENT_ID}}' || 'G-XXXXXXXXXX';
    // ... rest of the code
</script>
```

**Recommendation**: For your static site setup with Netlify, **Option A (Direct Code)** is simpler and more reliable.

## Step 5: Deploy and Test

2. Visit your website
